# What is AuUI

** Project is not finished **

**AuUI**, an abbreviation for "Actual Understandable User Interface" is a graphical user interface framework to help you build your projects quicker and easier. 
It's built on top of [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) with additional features to make it easier to create good designs without working hard to get a specific feature added.

## Usage/Examples

Doing basic Text & Buttons using AuUI
```c++
int WINAPI WinMain(HINSTANCE hInstance, HINSTANCE hPrevInstance, LPSTR lpCmdLine, int nCmdShow)
{

}
```

  

## Installation

```bash

# What's AuUI

** Project is not finished **

**AuUI**, an abbreviation for "Actual Understandable User Interface" is a graphical user interface framework to help you build your projects quicker and easier. 
It's built on top of [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) with additional features to make it easier for a beginner to create softwares using ImGui.

## Usage/Examples

Creating Window's are super easy now and will make your code look cleaner instead of having a 200 lines 
of code just to make a window (with Directx)
<br><br>
You can just do the following.
```c++
int WINAPI WinMain(HINSTANCE hInstance, HINSTANCE hPrevInstance, LPSTR lpCmdLine, int nCmdShow)
{

}
```

  

## Installation

As this project is primarily about simplicity, the installation is also easy; hence do the following.

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/SorryX/AuUI
```

After that, you include all of the files inside "includes" and you are done.

You can also download the project if you do not want to install "git".

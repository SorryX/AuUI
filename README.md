# What's AuUI

**AuUI** which is abbreviation for Actual Understanble User Interface. You might wonder why that name because a lot of GUI Frameworks are super difficult to understand
and overly complicated to build and use.

In AuUI you will understand how to modify stuff like size, position easily without any extra stuff


## Installation

As this project is primarily about simplicity that means the installation is also easy, thus do the following.

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/SorryX/AuUI
```

That's it after that you just include all of the files inside "includes" and you're done.
You can also just download the project if you don't want to install "git".

## What does this project use

This project uses directX to draw all it's elements e.g buttons, checkboxes
but it uses Windows API to make a window and for events.

# What's AuUI

**AuUI** which is abbreviation for Actual Understanble User Interface. You might wonder why that name because a lot of GUI Frameworks are super difficult to understand
and overly complicated to build and use.

In AuUI you will understand how to modify stuff like size, position easily without any extra stuff

# What's AuUI

**AuUI**, an abbreviation for "Actual Understandable User Interface" is a graphical user interface framework to help you build your projects quicker and easier. 

You might wonder why I chose that name, and the reasoning behind it is that all other frameworks are complicated and harder to understand; that is not the case with AuUI due to it having understandable code and comments that tell you exactly what a specific file does or a line.

## Installation

As this project is primarily about simplicity that means the installation is also easy, thus do the following.

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/SorryX/AuUI
```

That's it after that you just include all of the files inside "includes" and you are done.

You can also just download the project if you don't want to install "git".
